# Kickstarter EDA Review of Chris Linke (calinke)'s Notebook
## Brian's notes and comments...

1a. Looks like you're using straight Python here but Pandas makes things so much faster and easier. I recommend using Pandas instead, these EDAs are great practice for it.  *follow up: just saw your note on Trello that you switched over to Pandas halfway through the EDA.  Good to hear!*

2b. Perfect job getting the top 5 and displaying both the name and the usd_pledged_real amounts.  Pandas makes this so much easier.

2d. Looks like this one was challenging for you (it was for most of us).  Take a look at [Bojan's](https://github.com/QQ-88/2020.01.25-Kickstarter/blob/master/eda_kickstarter.ipynb), [Marina's](https://github.com/tchintchie/EDA_of_Kickstarter/blob/master/eda-of-kickstarter-data.ipynb), or [my notebook](https://github.com/BrianLeip/Data_Science_EDA/blob/master/Kickstarter%20Projects/Kickstarter%20Project%20EDA.ipynb) to get ideas how to tackle it.

Don't stop now, keep going!  If you get stuck and need a hand, give a shout out to the group. Someone will give you a hand.
