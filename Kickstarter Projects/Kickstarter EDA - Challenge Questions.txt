Questions to Answer:
1a. Examine the state column to see unique values and counts.
1b. Show a pie chart of the state project count for all projects.
1c. Create a new "Completed" dataframe that removes any rows with state of 'live', 'undefined', or suspended.
note - from here out we'll be looking at the completed project data unless mentioned otherwise

2a. What is the overall success rate for all completed kickstarter projects?
2b. Which 5 projects were pledged the most money (usd_pledged_real)?
2c. Which 5 projects had the most backers?
2d. Which year had the most competition? (# of projects)

3a. What is the success rate for all projects broken down by main_category? 3b. Show a horizontal bar chart for project success rate by main_category, sorted by highest to lowest.
3c. Within the Games main_category, what is the success rate for each category within it?

4a. Calculate the 'pct_of_goal' for each completed project.
4b. What were the top 5 projects when looking at pct_of_goal for all time?
4c. Plot a histogram distribution of all completed projects by pct_of_goal
4d. Create 2 histogram subplots by pct_of_goal: 1) state=successful, and 2) all others (failed)

5a. What is the average usd_goal_real for all completed kickstarter projects, broken down by main_category. 5b. What is the median usd_goal_real for all completed kickstarter projects, broken down by main_category. 5c. What is the average usd_pledged_real for all completed kickstarter projects, broken down by main_category. 5d. What is the median usd_pledged_real for all completed kickstarter projects, broken down by main_category. 5e. What insights does this information provide? (be creative)
5f. Based on this information, if someone wanted to choose the main_category with the highest combined success rate and pledged dollar amount, which one would you recommend?

6a. Create a new column 'months' that shows how many months the project was active between launch and deadline.
6b. Compare the avg months for successful projects vs non-successful. Add visuals if you'd like.
6c. Does the length of a project in months seem to have an impact?

Let's zoom in on Games: Video Games (main_category: category)

7a. Calculate the expected value for the Games: Video Games category, with the expected value defined as (median of usd_pledged_real)* (success rate of completed projects).
7b. Do this again but broken down by deadline year
7c. Show this in a bar chart
7d. What insights does this data provide you?

Let's zoom in on personal planners

8a. Calculate the count, success rate, and pct_of_goal for all projects with 'planner' in the name.
8b. How about all projects with both 'planner' and 'Panda' in the name?

Future ML project: Given a sample kickstarter project, can you predict the usd_pledged_real, and whether it will be successful? What features (data points) are most important in determining if a project will be successful or not?
